## 📋 Problem Statement

 * https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/
 * You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
 *
 * Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
 *
 * The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
 * Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
 * Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
 * The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
